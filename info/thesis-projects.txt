Generic guideline
=================

All undergraduate thesis are research-oriented and they need to have a factor
of novelty.  Their generic theme must be in the area of system security and
privacy. We have some topics, below, but if you have your own topic, we would
like to hear from you, as long as it falls in the area of security and privacy.

Required skills for working with us are: C/C++ programming, Operating Systems,
systems programming, scripting.


Undergraduate thesis projects
=============================

- Software exploitation. We explore the security guarantees of memory-safety
  systems-oriented programming languages, such as Rust and Go.

  We, also, want to improve our web fuzzer.

- Privacy-preserving fitness analytics. We explore how modern fitness-related
  social networks (i.e., Strava, TrainingPeaks) behave with respect to user's
  privacy. We seek on researching: (a) new privacy attacks, and (b) new
  privacy-preserving views. Specifically, for (b), we seek on building similar
  applications that generate fitness analytics without exposing sensitive data.

- Authentication. We build defenses for protecting a server against password leaks.
