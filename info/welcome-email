Dear all, 

welcome to SREC, a research group with focus on security and privacy.
Information about our research can be found at: https://srec.cs.ucy.ac.cy

Some further useful information. We use MS groups for exchanging e-mails. I
have already subscribed you to the group, hence you are receiving this e-mail.
We also use Keybase (https://keybase.io) for instant messaging. You can
register with Keybase and then search for @elathan. Once you find and follow
me, I can then add you to the @srec channel in Keybase. Please, use IM and
Keybase only when you really have urgent issues and you need a fast reply from
me. If the matter is not urgent, please, use e-mail. If you indeed use Keybase
and do not receive a reply from me, it doesn't mean that I ignore you, but that
I am busy.

We, also, use Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org) to push our code. Normally, you
will need to store your code at a later stage. Whenever you need to do this,
register with Bitbucket and send me your username to put you in our group. You
don't need to do this now.

Since your thesis will be with us, we need to find a research topic. For this,
we will need to have a short discussion. Before booking a slot with MS Teams,
it will be good to let me know the topics that are interesting more to you or
the topics that are really *not* interesting to you. This will help me to
narrow down the options we have. You can send me this information by e-mail and
then we can arrange a slot to have a short chat (around 15 minutes) using MS
Teams.
